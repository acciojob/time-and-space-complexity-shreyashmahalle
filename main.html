    <!-- First Paragraph: Time Complexity -->
    <p>
        Time complexity is a way to express how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. 
        It helps in analyzing whether an algorithm is efficient or not.
    </p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph: Space Complexity -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion. 
        It includes both temporary and permanent storage. A common notation to represent space complexity is O(n).
